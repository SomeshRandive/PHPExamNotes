PHP operators are special symbols or keywords that perform operations on values and variables. They are essential for building expressions and creating logic in PHP code. Hereâ€™s an overview of the different types of operators in PHP:

1. Arithmetic Operators
These operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.

Operator	Description	Example
+	Addition	$a + $b
-	Subtraction	$a - $b
*	Multiplication	$a * $b
/	Division	$a / $b
%	Modulus (remainder)	$a % $b
**	Exponentiation (power)	$a ** $b
Example:



<?php
    $a = 10;
    $b = 2;
    echo $a + $b; // Output: 12
    echo $a ** $b; // Output: 100
?>


2. Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

Operator	Description	Example
=	Assign	$a = $b
+=	Add and assign	$a += $b
-=	Subtract and assign	$a -= $b
*=	Multiply and assign	$a *= $b
/=	Divide and assign	$a /= $b
%=	Modulus and assign	$a %= $b
Example:



<?php
    $a = 10;
    $a += 5; // $a = $a + 5, so $a is now 15
    echo $a; // Output: 15
?>

3. Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values.

Operator	Description	Example
==	Equal	$a == $b
===	Identical (equal and same type)	$a === $b
!=	Not equal	$a != $b
<>	Not equal	$a <> $b
!==	Not identical	$a !== $b
>	Greater than	$a > $b
<	Less than	$a < $b
>=	Greater than or equal to	$a >= $b
<=	Less than or equal to	$a <= $b
<=>	Spaceship (returns -1, 0, or 1)	$a <=> $b
Example:



<?php
    $a = 10;
    $b = 20;
    echo $a <=> $b; // Output: -1, because $a is less than $b
?>
4. Increment/Decrement Operators
These operators are used to increase or decrease the value of a variable by 1.

Operator	Description	Example
++$a	Pre-increment	Increments $a by 1, then returns $a.
$a++	Post-increment	Returns $a, then increments $a by 1.
--$a	Pre-decrement	Decrements $a by 1, then returns $a.
$a--	Post-decrement	Returns $a, then decrements $a by 1.
Example:



<?php
    $a = 5;
    echo ++$a; // Output: 6 (pre-increment)
    echo $a--; // Output: 6, then $a becomes 5 (post-decrement)
?>
5. Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements.

Operator	Description	Example
&&	AND (both must be true)	$a && $b
`		`
!	NOT (reverses true/false)	!$a
and	AND (lower precedence)	$a and $b
or	OR (lower precedence)	$a or $b
xor	XOR (only one can be true)	$a xor $b
Example:



<?php
    $a = true;
    $b = false;
    echo $a && $b; // Output: (empty), because false is returned
    echo $a || $b; // Output: 1, because true is returned
?>
6. String Operators
PHP offers two operators specifically for string manipulation.

Operator	Description	Example
.	Concatenation	$a . $b
.=	Concatenation and assign	$a .= $b
Example:



<?php
    $greeting = "Hello";
    $greeting .= " World!";
    echo $greeting; // Output: Hello World!
?>
7. Array Operators
Array operators are used to compare and manipulate arrays.

Operator	Description	Example
+	Union (combines arrays)	$a + $b
==	Equality (same key-value pairs)	$a == $b
===	Identity (same key-value pairs in same order)	$a === $b
!=	Inequality	$a != $b
<>	Inequality	$a <> $b
!==	Non-identity	$a !== $b
Example:



<?php
    $arr1 = array("a" => "red", "b" => "green");
    $arr2 = array("c" => "blue", "d" => "yellow");
    $result = $arr1 + $arr2;
    print_r($result); 
    // Output: Array ( [a] => red [b] => green [c] => blue [d] => yellow )
?>
8. Type Operators
Type operators check if an object is an instance of a particular class.

Operator	Description	Example
instanceof	Checks if an object is an instance of a class	$obj instanceof ClassName
Example:



<?php
    class Car {}
    $myCar = new Car();
    echo $myCar instanceof Car; // Output: 1 (true)
?>
9. Null Coalescing Operator
The null coalescing operator ?? checks if a variable exists and is not null; if it is null, it returns a default value.



<?php
    $username = $_GET['username'] ?? 'Guest';
    echo $username; // Output: 'Guest' if 'username' is not set in the query string
?>
10. Spaceship Operator
The spaceship operator <=> is used to compare two expressions. It returns -1, 0, or 1, depending on whether the left side is less than, equal to, or greater than the right side.



<?php
    echo 10 <=> 20; // Output: -1
    echo 20 <=> 20; // Output: 0
    echo 30 <=> 20; // Output: 1
?>
